            <a class="terms-text"><b>1. Terms</b><br>By accessing the website at http://thetechyjuan.com, you are
                agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you
                are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these
                terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are
                protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.<br><br><b>2. Use License</b><br>Permission is
                granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on TheTechyJuan's
                website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a
                transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
                modify or copy the materials;
                use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
                attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on TheTechyJuan's website;
                remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
                transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
                This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be
                terminated by TheTechyJuan at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the
                termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in
                electronic or printed format.<br><br><b>3. Disclaimer</b><br>The materials on TheTechyJuan's website are
                provided on an 'as is' basis. TheTechyJuan makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby
                disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
                conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual
                property or other violation of rights.
                Further, TheTechyJuan does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely
                results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such
                materials or on any sites linked to this site.

                damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business
                interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on TheTechyJuan's website, even
                if TheTechyJuan or a TheTechyJuan authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of
                the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
                warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may
                not apply to you.<br><br><b>5. Accuracy of materials</b><br>The materials appearing on TheTechyJuan's
                website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. TheTechyJuan does not warrant
                that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. TheTechyJuan may make
                changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However TheTechyJuan does
                not make any commitment to update the materials.<br><br><b>6. Links</b><br>TheTechyJuan has not reviewed
                all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site.
                The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by TheTechyJuan of the site. Use of any such linked

                irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.<br><br><b>Privacy
